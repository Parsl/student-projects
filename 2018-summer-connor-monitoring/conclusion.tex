A monitoring solution has been added to the Parsl workflow software.
This solution uses Elasticsearch and Kibana to store and present recorded workflow information.
The significance of this project is that it clearly outlines a simple and effective way to provide information to users independent of the execution location.
Clear use cases for such techniques are in live monitoring of the execution of workflows that are being executed on arbitrary and potentially distributed locations.
This solution also demonstrates how monitoring may be simplified by separating the components into specialized tools.

The present solution lacks user testing.
Such feedback and experience reports should be collected and incorporated into the UI to increase the usability of monitoring.
Future iterations of monitoring in Parsl will ideally incorporate such feedback.
More customizable solutions for monitoring may be achieved by using the same strategies but with different visualization tools.

In summary, this work has demonstrated that remote monitoring of arbitrary software can be effectively achieved using straightforward tools such as Elasticsearch and Kibana.
